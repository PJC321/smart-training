# Training

Congratulations on completing onboarding! The next step of your journey is to complete **training**. By the end of training, you will be a **[junior developer](../progression/trainee/README.md)** you will be able to say (and evidence) the following:

- Top-level goal 1 (could be a workflow)
- Top-level goal 2 (could be a workflow)
- Top-level goal 3 (could be a workflow)
- Top-level goal 4 (could be a workflow)
- Top-level goal 5 (could be a workflow)

> :construction: note to curriculum designers â€“ I've added a couple more goal slots here you can fill. Keep it below 5 (3 is best). Think of goals as "positive statements I can say about myself", objectives as "more detailed breakdowns of the TLG", and activities as "a given way to evidence an objective".

Just as with [onboarding](../onboarding/README.md), We've decomposed these top-level goals into a list of objectives. You can evidence these objectives however you want. If you want some guidance, we've paired each objective with an activity: completing the activity counts as evidencing the objective.

## Top-level goal 1

This goal means the following thing: (goal in plain words anyone could understand). In context, this means you will be able to (which superpowers this goal will unlock).
