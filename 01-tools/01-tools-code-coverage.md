# Tools: code coverage

Previously, you’ve installed and configured Rubocop for static code analysis. Today, we’ll also use an analyzer but we’ll focus on code coverage managed by **simplecov**.

## Learning objectives covered

* Use simplecov
* Identify places missing specs

## To complete this challenge, you’ll need to

* Install `simplecov`
* Configure simplecov so it skips `channels` directory
* Set minimum coverage to 92
* Open `coverage/index.html` and identify files missing tests
* Write missing tests
