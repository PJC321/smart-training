# Dockerise the app

## Outcomes

- Deployment/Docker

## Description

In the previous ticket, deployed your app to Heroku using Git.

In this ticket, you will deploy your app to Heroku using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## To complete this ticket, you must:

- [ ] Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
- [ ] Define `.dockerignore`.
- [ ] Create a dedicated Docker image for your application.
  - Don't forget about JS dependencies.
- [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` file and configure multiple containers, such as the application, database and so on.
- [ ] Update `database.yml` file.
- [ ] Configure environment variables accordingly.

## Tips
