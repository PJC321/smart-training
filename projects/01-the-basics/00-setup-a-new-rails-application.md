Welcome to the Smartflix Basics project!

In this ticket, you will build a basic, dummy, unstyled version of the Smartflix homepage. Here's how it will look:

![Basic Smartflix page](../images/smartflix-1.png)

## To complete this ticket, you will need to:

- [ ] Set up a new [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) app called `smartflix`.
- [ ] Write an acceptance test using [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) that asserts: when the user visits the index route (`/`), the page content includes `Smartflix`.
- [ ] Create a new route, controller, and view to pass the acceptance test. Make sure you're following the [Rails conventions](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)!
