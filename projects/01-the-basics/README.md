# The Basics

Learn the basics by creating a homepage for SmartFlix!

When you're done, you'll have a beautiful, styled homepage showing a list of movies stored in a database, deployed on Heroku with Docker.

In this project, we won't be doing much testing. Instead, you'll be focusing on a working app, hosted live on the web. But testing will be a big feature from the next project onwards!
