# Projects

Smart Academy is organised into a set of **projects**, which each contain several **issues**. Issues are tagged with **labels** that represent the skills. All progress is tracked using [Techmap](https://graph.techmap.app).

## What's in this folder?

Each directory represents a **project**. Projects start with an ID and have hyphenated names (e.g. `01-the-basics`). Projects are made up of:

1. A README that gives a brief overview of the project.
2. Several documents that comprise the **issues** developers must solve.

Issues are written in a [challenge-based](https://sjmog.github.io/posts/484_building_challenge_learning_curricula/) format.

## What happens next?

When a learner starts an activity using [Techmap](https://graph.techmap.app):

1. The relevant project is duplicated to their personal Github account as a [Github Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects).
2. If the learner doesn't have a `smartflix` repo, one is created for them.
3. All issues in the project directory are added to their `smartflix` repo, and tracked into their Github Project.

When a learner completes a project (see the [Training documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) for how), they can select a new activity on Techmap from whichever activities they've unlocked.

## I want to make a project!
