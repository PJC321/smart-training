# Views: homepage

So far, our challenges were only backend-related. This time we’ll play with some views, namely homepage. We’re going to add an index action and display movies that we have in the database. To make it prettier, we’ll use **Bootstrap** as a **CSS framework**.

## Learning objectives covered

* Define root page
* Install and use Bootstrap
* Use Haml
* Use pagination

## To complete this challenge, you’ll need to

* Add an index action to the controller
* Define the root page in routes
* Install Boostrap. Please notice that Bootstrap 5 requires jQuery and PopperJS (in version 2.x).
* Install Haml
* Install e.g. `kaminari` for pagination
  * `will_paginate` is unfortunately in maintenance mode
* Prepare an index view
* Include pagination in the view
