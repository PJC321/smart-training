## FAQ

#### What is a "trainee developer"?
A trainee developer has completed onboarding and is ready to begin training on topics and workflows used at Smart Pension.

#### What is a "junior developer"?
A junior developer has completed Smart Academy training and is ready to begin work in a feature team.

#### Is there a time limit?
We'd expect you to be a junior developer within 3â€“6 months of starting at Smart Pension.

#### What is the "progression meeting"?
When you feel that you are ready to qualify as a [junior developer](./junior/README.md), book a meeting with your **Enginering manager**. The meeting is an informal discussion where the following will happen:
- Your manager will take a look at your evidence against the [junior developer progression framework](./junior/README.md)
- You'll discuss any areas in which you're feeling less confident.
- If you both agree that there's enough evidence against the framework and you're ready to progress, you'll progress to junior developer.
