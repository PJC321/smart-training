# Training

Congratulations on completing onboarding! The next step of your journey is to complete **training**. By the end of training, you will be a **Junior Developer** you will be able to say (and evidence) the following:

- I can build a tested, robust, scalable Rails application.
- I can apply Smart workflows and idioms during development.
- I can collaborate and grow myself and other developers.

## How do I get promoted?

By providing **credible evidence** that you've hit the top-level goals.

You can evidence hitting these goals however you want. For instance:

- Completing a tickets that demonstrates you can build a tested Rails feature.
- Contributing to internal documentation or blogging about how Smart uses units to organise the model layer.
- Screenshotting a great coaching conversation on Slack.

As part of Smart Academy, we've prepared a set of projects (on [Techmap](https://graph.techmap.app)) that cover all the skills we'd expect to see as part of credibly hitting these goals. It's a great place to start.

## What do the goals mean?

## I can build a tested, robust, scalable Rails application.

Hitting this goal means you can turn a set of requirements into high-quality, tested code using the Rails framework in such a way as it stays fast, stable, and responsive. In the context of your work, this means you will be able to contribute high-quality features within a Smart feature team.

## I can apply Smart workflows and idioms during development.

Hitting this goal means you can work alongside colleagues at Smart to build high-quality features using a shared set of approaches. In the context of your work, this means your contributions will spend less time in review, and you and your team will spend more time shipping.

## I can collaborate and grow myself and other developers.

Hitting this goal means you care about and are able to help yourself and others grow at Smart. In the context of your work, this means your (and your colleagues') skills and career will develop faster, and Smart will overall be a fun, growth-y place to work.
