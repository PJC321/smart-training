# Onboarding

Welcome to Smart Pension! The first step of your journey is to complete **onboarding**. By the end of onboarding, you will be a **[trainee developer](../progression/trainee/README.md)** you will be able to say (and evidence) the following:

- Top-level goal 1
- Top-level goal 2
- Top-level goal 3

We've decomposed these top-level goals into a list of objectives. You can evidence these objectives however you want. If you want some guidance, we've paired each objective with an activity: completing the activity counts as evidencing the objective.

## Top-level goal 1
