# Progression framework: Junior developer

This progression framework details everything you should be able to evidence to be a **junior developer** at Smart.

## How do I become a Smart junior developer?

Here's how the process works:

1. You complete activities in the [training](../../training/README.md) section, collecting evidence that you can hit the top-level goals detailed there.
2. Once you're confident you have enough evidence you've hit the top-level goals, book a [progression meeting](../README.md) with your **Engineering Manager**.
