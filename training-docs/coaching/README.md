# Coaching

So you want to be a coach! Awesome. By coaching devs, you'll learn:

- How to give amazing feedback that helps your colleagues grow.
- How to support early-career developers through some of the more traumatic parts of figuring out how to make computers work.
- How to be a thoughtful, effective mentor, manager, and leader.

> Coaching is pretty new at Smart, so this documentation will evolve over time.

## What are my responsibilities?

Your top-line responsibility is to **help trainee developers grow into effective juniors**. Trainees may be new to the world of software engineering, and they'll need your support to become confident, happy, and productive.

First, we recommend familiarising yourself with the [training overview](../README.md). This gives you a picture of what trainee developers are doing, and what they're working towards.

Your main responsibility is to make sure that trainees receive **timely** and **constructive** feedback on their tickets. When a trainee completes a ticket, the #smart-academy-reviewers Slack channel will get a message. There's also a rollup message of all tickets awaiting feedback sent to the channel in the morning.

- By **timely**, we recommend that tickets aren't left waiting for more than 24 hours. (They might be blocking trainee progress.)
- By **constructive**, we mean the review follows the [Google Code Review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/) ethos.

## What should I do right now?

- Join the #coaching channel on Slack.
- Reach out to either [Grzegorz](grzegorz.unijewski@smartpension.co.uk) or [Sam](sam@x27.dev) on Slack to have a little intro chat.
