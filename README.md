The curriculum for taking a new Smart dev from zero to trainee to junior.

1. **[Onboarding](./onboarding/README.md)**. After completing onboarding, they are a **[trainee](./progression/trainee/README.md)**.
2. **[Training](./training/README.md)**. After completing training, they are a **[junior](./progression/junior/README.md)**.
